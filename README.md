# Udacity-Data-Analysis-Nanodegree
Data analysis projects I've worked for data analysis nanodegree.

## Skills/environment required
- Python (3.x or higher)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
And additional libraries defined in each project.

## Project Overview
### P1. Explore weather trend
This chapter was an introduction to the following projects of the Data Analyst Nanodegree.
I explored New York temparature by comparing it with global average temparature.
- Tip. Used moving average based upon recent 7 years temerature data

### P2. Investigate a dataset
This chapter covers overal process of data analysis. 
[Introduction to data analysis]
- Data analysis process : Question -> Wrangle -> Explore -> Draw conclusion -> Communicate
- Question : whether data is given or not
- Wrangling : gather, assess, clean (missing, duplicate, wrong/incorrect data type)
[Project : TMDb movie data analysis]

### P3. Analyze A/B Test Results
This project is under "Practical Statistics" sessions dealing with overall statistics concepts and knowledge. it also includes how we can prove or utilize Python to prove those statistical concepts, and A/B test project is one of them.  
[Project : Analyze A/B Test Results]
To goal of the project in this chapter was to get experience with A/B testing. 

### P4. Wrangle and analyze data
Data wrangling procedure consists of 3 stpes: gather, assess, clean. In order to be prepared for the real world cases, it dealt with using various data format from csv file to the data from website. 
[Project : Twitter WeRateDog API data Wrangling]

### P5. Communicate data findings
Visualiztion and communication of the data is important not only for client but also for us to find basic pattern of the data. This chapter covers which visualizatino could be used best for univarate, bivaritae and multivariate.
